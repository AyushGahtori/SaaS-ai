User clicks "Sign Up"
    ↓
onSubmit runs (async function)
    ↓
setLoading(true) → Button shows "Signing up..."
    ↓
await authClient.signUp.email(...) → WAITS here for server response
    ↓
Server processes signup (creates user in database)
    ↓
Server sends back response (success or error)
    ↓
await finishes, code continues
    ↓
onSuccess or onError callback runs
    ↓
setMessage() or setError() updates the UI
    ↓
finally block runs → setLoading(false) → Button re-enables
    ↓
User sees success/error message

async = "This function will take time, I might need to wait"
await = "Stop here and wait for the answer before continuing"
onSuccess/onError = "When the answer comes back, do this"
Without await, the code would continue immediately without waiting for the response
