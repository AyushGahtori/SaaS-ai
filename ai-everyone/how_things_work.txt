In our project we dont have to update our database structure manually 
to match the databae schema.
with most ORM we write, we write migration files manually.
and then do npm run migrate

but in our project we use Drizzle ORM, we use push insted there is a
line in our package.json that comes with the Drizzle database
"db:push": "drizzle-kit push"
so we only have to use the command
npm run db:push

example- 
// Before
email: varchar('email')

// After
email: varchar('email').unique()  // Added unique constraint

just run the command the cloud database structure will be updated automaticly.





DataBase schema - database schema defines the structure of the database
for example how many character will be allowed in the names section 
id is the primary key
email should be unique
just like sql




importing with and without { }
if we import like { db } the expost of bd
should be as const 
in expost default we only do import db




route.ts and how it is used in our project:
route.ts is a special Next.js file that handles HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) for an API endpoint.
use of [...all]:
when a req comes form /api/auth
like /api/auth/signup or /api/auth/login
insted of having seperate folder for each of them a signup folder and a login folder
we have this [...all] folder all the trafic will go in this only file
and it will handel all the requests
we dont need many folder and many route.ts



import * as schema from "@/db/schema" means import every thing form that file
not just a perticular module
...schema means spread everything just imported



async meens this function will take time I might need to wait
await = "Stop here and wait for the answer before continuing"
onSuccess/onError = "When the answer comes back, do this"




const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
these helps in rendering different things these are called state variables, usestate hooks
it rerender stuff when needed
loading = current value (starts as false)
setLoading = function to update it
When you call setLoading(true), React re-renders the component with the new value
example workflow
const onSubmit = async () => {
  setLoading(true);  // Button shows "Signing up..."
  
  try {
    await authClient.signUp.email({...}); // Wait for signup
    setMessage("Success!"); // Show success
  } catch (err) {
    setError(err.message); // Show error
  } finally {
    setLoading(false); // Hide loading state
  }
}

so when we click the signup button it will set the loadingto true
and when its done it will make it false again
by default it will be false





"use Client"; at top of a file in Next.js
this marks a file as a client component in next js
Server Components by default: In the Next.js App Router, all components are Server Components by default, meaning they run on the server.
Client-side interactivity: By adding "use client"; at the top, you're telling Next.js that this component needs to run in the browser
so we can use things like react hooks
handle user interaction and assess browser api
common use case is when we need an interactive form
in which there are even listner like button.
